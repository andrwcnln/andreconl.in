Hi! My name is Andrew Conlin. I am a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-conlin-61320a257/" target="_blank">software engineer</a> and <a href="http://andrewconlinphotography.co.uk" target="_blank">photographer</a>, currently based in Cambridge, England.
<br>
<br>
My main hobbies are film photography and running. I love <a href="https://letterboxd.com/andrewconlin/">watching movies</a>, especially in the cinema. I love post-punk, dreampop and experimental hip hop. I love drinking good coffee, good beer and good whisky. I am also a passionate self-hoster, and like to think that I'm at least somewhat privacy conscious.  
<br>
<br>
I mainly use this site as a space for my blog, where I post interesting things I've found, and some of my (not so interesting) thoughts. Inspired by <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a>, I also post my TIL series here. Any time I run into a weird error while programming, I post the full error message and the fix that I found, to hopefully help someone down the line.
