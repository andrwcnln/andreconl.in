However, it is in desperate need of an update.</p>

<p>In this post, I will set out the existing problems with the game, then how I aim to resolve them, and conclude with a summary of the amazing of the brand-spanking new edition.</p>

<p>For the record, I am writing this post because the game is bad, not because I always lose to my girlfriend and have decided to change the rules rather than accept defeat<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h1 id="1-the-problems">1. The problems</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Lack of options</li>
  <li>Scissors picked disproportionately</li>
  <li>General lack of whimsy</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="2-fixing-the-problems">2. Fixing the problems</h1>
<h2 id="how-many-extra-options-should-we-add">How many extra options should we add?</h2>
<h3 id="graph-theory">Graph theory</h3>
<p>Before we dive in, let me give you some Graph Theory 101. First some terms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>vertex: a point in space</li>
  <li>edge: connects any two points</li>
  <li>vertices are joined with edges to create graphs</li>
  <li>to begin with, we will have undirected graphs, where edges have no direction associated with them</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, to represent the current setup for RPS, we can have the following</p>

<script src="/assets/js/typograms.js"></script>

<script type="text/typogram">  
.
           o rock
          / \ 
         /   \
        /     \
 paper o-------o scissors
.
 </script>

<p>Each possible hand is a vertex, and each edge is a game. In graph theory, a complete graph is one where every pair of vertices is connected by a unique edge. Intuitively you can see that rock, paper scissors is complete, otherwise there would be combinations that couldn’t be played against each other.</p>

<p>Another concept that I now need to introduce is that of degree. The degree of a vertex is the total number of edges it is connected to. This is the second criterion that we need to fulfill: Every vertex must have the same degree. This is known as a regular graph. The exisiting RPS graph is also regular, with degree 2 (2-regular). We need to satisfy this with our new graph.</p>

<p>It is now time to introduce direction to our graph, used to represent winners and losers. Here is the RPS graph with directions representing who will win each game, also known as a digraph.</p>

<script type="text/typogram">
.
           o rock
          ^ \ 
         /   \
        /     v
 paper o <-----o scissors
.
</script>

<p>Rock beats scissors etc. etc.</p>

<p>More specifically, we want an oriented graph. There shouldn’t be any bidirectionality between vertices, which would indicate a draw.</p>

<p>A complete, oriented graph is called a tournament.</p>

<p>Buidling on out definition of regularity from the non-directed graphs, we have directional regularity (indegree = outdegree). A tournament where each of the vertices is regular is called a “regular tournament”. This specific type of digraph satisfies all our criteria, and any new game that we create must be regular tournament.</p>

<ol>
  <li>complete (every hand can play every hand)</li>
  <li>regular (every hand can participate in the same number of possible games)</li>
  <li>oriented (every game results in a winner)</li>
  <li>indegree = outdegree for all vertices (each hand wins as many as it loses)</li>
</ol>

<p>Number of regular tournaments for numbers of nodes (even no. of nodes excluded because they have an odd degree, and therefore no regular tournaments):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Nodes</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Degree</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Regular Tournaments</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">0</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">3</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">5</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">4</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">24</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">7</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">6</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2640</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">.</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">.</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">.</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">.</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>as much as I would love to look at all of the possible 2640 combinations for a 7 player tournament, 5 possible hands looks like our sweetspot here, both in terms of the possible winner/loser combinations and in terms of the brain capacity of people playing the game.</p>

Ultimately, I think it comes down to this:</p>

<p><em>How easily can I translate what I am thinking about into a working setup?</em></p>

<p>That is, how much effort needs to go into converting my idea into a solution? (If there is not already a word for this, then there should be. Don’t worry, I am willing to take the hit and have it named after me.)</p>

<p>For example, I’ve been building this website over the past month or so. Generally, for static websites, I think that HTML + CSS are very good at allowing me to get what I see in my head running on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost</code>. At this point CSS has so many different options that you just need to find the right search terms in order to get what you want.</p>

<p>However, they are both lacking somewhat in <em>intuitiveness</em>. Especially when starting out, it can get very confusing to know the right tags and the right syntax and the right placement (and so on) to realise your vision.</p>

<p>This is where services like Squarespace et al. come into play. They give you that intuitive UI, dragging and dropping of features, resizing and changing colours. They make it super duper easy to do the actual building, at the cost of the range of bricks you can use.</p>

<p>So, we have two measures:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Can I do everything I want to?</li>
  <li>How easy is it?</li>
</ol>

<p>These are usually a direct tradeoff, with ease typically preferred over options. This tends to frustrate me, as I want full control of all those little configurations.</p>

<p>The solution to this, at least for me, are frameworks such as Bootstrap and Jekyll. They put a layer between the user and the options; essentially translating and simplying all the little configurations into something much easier to work with. Columns in Bootstrap make page layouts simple; markdown-to-html parsing in Jekyll makes text formatting a breeze. But, most importantly of all, these frameworks don’t sacrifice on the possibilities. They make it easier to apply complex setups, but if you want to go in and tweak absolutely everything to your liking, go right ahead. By providing the user with simpler ways of doing the same things as before, they manage to bridge the gap between <em>Can I do everything I want to?</em> and <em>How easy is it?</em>. And I think that is beautiful.</p>]]></content><author><name>Andrew Conlin</name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I’ve been using multiple different languages and frameworks (both at work and personally) and I’ve been thinking about why I prefer some over others.
