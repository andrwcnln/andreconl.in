_"For starters, it finds that publishing a link can be a "performance" of a copyrighted work, which meant that when Linkletter linked to the world-viewable Youtube files that Proctorio had posted, he infringed on copyright._

_This is a perverse, even surreal take on copyright. The court rejects Linkletter's argument that even Youtube's terms of service warned Proctorio that publishing world-viewable material on its site constituted permission for people to link to and watch that material."_
