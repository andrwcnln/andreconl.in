I've realised that going to the cinema makes me sad; a quiet, contemplative melancholy. Ennui. No matter the film, something about the cinema experience is meditative for me. I always look at things differently in the aftermath; like my perception is temporarily knocked off balance. No, more like a fog is lifted for a while. I especially enjoy that time immediately after, the cycle home. I notice so many little details, scenes of beauty and of strange nostalgia. Like I'm finally seeing the world how it is, or rather, I begin to see rather than look, listen rather than hear. I feel as though these moments, however brief, are when I am truly in touch with myself. My soul, my inner essence. This is why I love the cinema. These moments of private melancholy, of temporary clarity. It is a feeling I cannot replicate anywhere else in my life.
