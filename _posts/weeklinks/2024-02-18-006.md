Back again with some more links to save and share.

- First up, [this nice wee blog post](https://laplab.me/posts/whats-that-touchscreen-in-my-room/) about deciphering the meaning of a mysterious, wall-mounted touchscreen.

- For all you wiki folks out there, here is a [Netflix style front-end](https://wikidata-todo.toolforge.org/wikiflix/#/) which collates all of the freely available movies from the Wikimedia commons.

- Anyone who knows me knows I love a good coffee, and especially the black tar spewed out from a Moka pot. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VESMU7JfVHU) is a neutron scan of a Moka pot boiling, allowing you to see what happens inside. There is also [this wonderful site](https://www.scanofthemonth.com/scans/coffee) with its highly detailed scans of various coffee makers. (I can see Scan of the Month featuring heavily in future Weeklinks.)

- Back in [Weeklinks 002](https://andrewconl.in/weeklinks/002/), I shared a Mastodon thread about breaking DRM in Polish trains. Well, the folks behind it have just recently done a full breakdown presentation, which is available [here](https://media.ccc.de/v/37c3-12142-breaking_drm_in_polish_trains).

- [A deep dive](https://cohost.org/cathoderaydude/post/1228730-taking-the-deepest-p) into some increadibly niche OS tomfoolery from the late 2000s.

- I've always been interested in small programs, and the amazing things that can be achieved in just a few kB. [This](https://linusakesson.net/scene/a-mind-is-born/) takes that idea 1 step further, with an entire song and music video programmed in only 256 bytes on a Commodore 64. Truly unbelieveable stuff.

- [A sign of things to come](https://bc.ctvnews.ca/air-canada-s-chatbot-gave-a-b-c-man-the-wrong-information-now-the-airline-has-to-pay-for-the-mistake-1.6769454): a Canadian airline has tried to claim that it is not legally responsible for the information provided by its online chatbot. Obviously this is a blatant falsehood, but I am glad to see it struck down by the judge. Let's hope that future precedents also side with common sense.

- [This is a cool satellite image](https://universeodon.com/@nantel/111912809026371850) of the ongoing eruption in Iceland. The lava is edited in, but an amazing image nonetheless.

- Finally, [a good ole Simpsons joke, now officially in the dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/what-does-cromulent-mean).
